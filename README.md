# Suku
The sudoku library - a war on 9x9 grids.

## Goal
My aim in creating Suku is creating a ruby library for manipulating, generating and solving Sudoku games.

At present version 0.1.0, this is a learning exercise, so code can be badly factored and is often without tests - and some code is more exploratory and unoptimised.
